## üåü What is Enoverse?

Enoverse is a revolutionary **AI-powered Web3 RPG** that combines artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to create truly living digital assets. Our NFT characters don't just sit in your wallet - they **evolve, learn, and grow** through advanced AI algorithms that analyze your gameplay patterns.

### Current Stage: Working Prototype ‚úÖ

We've built a **fully functional frontend prototype** that demonstrates our core vision:
- Interactive character cards with dynamic stats and progression systems
- AI quest generation simulation with personalized missions
- Responsive cyberpunk-themed UI matching our game aesthetic
- Real-time character selection and minting simulation
